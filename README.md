# Spline Interpolation

In the mathematical field of numerical analysis, spline interpolation is a form of interpolation where the interpolant is a special type of piecewise polynomial called a spline.  
Originally, spline was a term for elastic rulers that were bent to pass through a number of predefined points ("knots"). These were used to make technical drawings for shipbuilding and construction by hand.  
The approach to mathematically model the shape of such elastic rulers fixed by n + 1 knots {(x<sub>i</sub>,y<sub>i</sub>):i=0,1, ... ,n} is to interpolate between all the pairs of knots (x<sub>i - 1</sub>,y<sub>i - 1</sub>) and (x<sub>i</sub>,y<sub>i</sub>) with polynomials y = q<sub>i</sub>(x), i = 1, 2, ..., n.
